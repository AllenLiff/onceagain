GUIDING PRINCIPLES
{: style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-size: 180%; text-align: center;"}


As we move forward with this exciting program, we are guided by the following principles:
Learn by doing: At each school, students will take on a hand-on approach to reducing waste â€“ including all the messy logistics!
Audit and measure: Students learn the basics of conducting a waste audit and how measure the outcomes of their waste reduction efforts.
Be a Community Organizer: As sustainability champions, students will need to mobilize their fellow students, thinking and acting like community organizers.
Work side-by-side with sustainable businesses and organizations: What better way for students to gain real world experience? Find out how your organization can help.
Be a role model: High School students make great ambassadors, encouraging elementary and middle-grade students to begin their own recycling programs.
Each team chooses its own project: To foster a spirit of collaborative leadership, student teams are responsible for researching and choosing which project(s) to pursue.
